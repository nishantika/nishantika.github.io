Hi There!

Welcome to my website. 
I am a Software Developer with three years of dedicated experience working at [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/). Throughout my tenure, I have actively contributed to the development of the API development framework utilized in [Nutanix's latest v4 APIs](https://www.nutanix.dev/api-reference-v4/). I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), which has provided me with a solid foundation for my professional endeavors.

Beyond my role as a Software Developer, I maintain a blog through [Medium](https://medium.com/@nishantikagarg). On this platform, I share my perspectives and learnings on a wide range of topics. 

Additionally, I pursuemy my passion for art by running an art page on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bynishantika/) where I showcase my amateur artwork.

Should you have any inquiries or wish to connect, please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:nishantikagarg@gmail.com). 

For a comprehensive overview of my qualifications and experiences, I invite you to refer to my [resume](/resume). 

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
